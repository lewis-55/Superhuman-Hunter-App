## ‚≠ê Introduction

This project is Super Hero Hunter App in which we use superheroAPI() to fetch the records and details of all the superheroes along with some additional features. It is built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript.

-  Users are Shown some ongoing Super Hero Videos playing in the background of the website.
-  Users can Enter their Problems in the form to which the most suitable Super Hero is assigned to Assist.
-  Users can Check out the famous Super Hero Quotes.
-  Users can Mark their Favourite Super Heroes in the 'favourites' section. It is stored persistently in the browser's local storage.
-  Users are able to Search for the Super Heroes by entering the name or searchable-term in the Search Input. It shows a list of results as autocomplete suggestions, which upon clicking directs us to that particular superhero card with all the information provided by the SuperHero() API.
